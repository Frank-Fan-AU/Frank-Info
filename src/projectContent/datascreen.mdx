# Project Overview: Large Screen Data Display Platform

This project aims to provide a centralized large screen data display platform for operations and maintenance (O&M) personnel. The platform consists of 12 smaller screens that can display various data and metrics as required by the O&M team. The team submits their data display requests, and we analyze the best way to present the data and develop the interface to display the data in a clear and intuitive manner.

## Key Features:

1. **Customizable Data Display:** O&M personnel can customize the content and layout of the display based on their needs, ensuring that the most critical data is presented in real-time.
   
2. **Efficient Data Visualization:** Provides charts, dashboards, and other display formats to help O&M personnel quickly understand trends and key metrics.
   
3. **Responsive Design:** The 12 small screens can be flexibly allocated to different views based on the requirements, allowing for multiple views to be displayed simultaneously, ensuring smooth information flow.

4. **Real-Time Data Updates:** Supports real-time data updates, ensuring that O&M personnel have access to the most up-to-date information to make timely decisions.

## Data Sources and Backend Integration:

This project integrates multiple data sources to provide O&M personnel with comprehensive, real-time information. The primary data sources include:

1. **ES Log Data:** Logs from Elasticsearch are retrieved to monitor and analyze system status and anomalies in real-time.
   
2. **Grafana Metric Data:** Metrics from Grafana are collected to display system performance indicators such as CPU, memory, and disk usage.

3. **Vendor API Data:** Vendor APIs are integrated to collect data on hardware devices, service status, and other external system data, ensuring that O&M personnel can monitor the environment from all aspects.

Throughout the development process, I work closely with these different backends to ensure stable and accurate data retrieval and display on the large screen.

## Technology Stack:

- **Vue2:** Used for building the frontend interface, providing a reactive and component-based structure for efficient development.
- **ECharts:** A powerful charting library used to visualize data through interactive graphs and charts.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests and fetching data from the backend.
- **Datav:** A UI component library tailored for data visualization and dashboard creation, helping to build a clean and functional user interface.

## Development Process:

1. **Requirement Analysis:** Communicate with O&M personnel to define data display requirements and objectives.
2. **Data Visualization Design:** Based on the requirements, design suitable visualizations and layouts.
3. **Interface Development:** Develop the front-end interface, ensuring its aesthetics and usability.
4. **Deployment and Optimization:** After development, deploy the solution to the large screen environment, test it, and optimize the performance to ensure smooth and stable operation.
