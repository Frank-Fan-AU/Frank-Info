Visa Dashboard is a user-centric platform designed to assist individuals navigating the Australian 500 visa application process. It provides tools, guides, and community-driven resources to simplify the visa application journey.

## Project Goal

While applying for an Australian visa, we noticed that many people were deeply concerned about:
- The daily visa approval numbers.
- The current processing dates for applications.
- Specific trends, such as how their profession or specialization impacts processing.
- Proper completion of application forms.
- Required supporting documents.

However, this information is scattered across various internet platforms and often cluttered with advertisements from agents, making it difficult to consolidate and analyze. To address these issues, I created **Visa Dashboard** to provide a structured and ad-free platform. It aims to offer accurate and consolidated information while fostering a supportive community.
